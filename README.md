## [Clinic_Management_App](https://github.com/GaneshDabhade/Clinic_Management_App) is a Clinic Management Application.

An Online Appointment Booking System for Retail Chain Clinics with both the User as well as the Admin Side.

**Purpose**  

In the traditional appointment system, patients have to come to the hospital and queue at the appointment window to make the appointment. But they usually end up waiting for very long periods of time. The patient can, however, decide to schedule an appointment, but this option does not usually work well for all parties involved. Parties involved include the patient, the medical personnel, and the hospital. Thus, this project focuses on making a system that helps customers to book appointments online along with other useful features. 

**Product Scope** 

An online appointment scheduling system is a system through which a user or simply, a patient can access the website of the doctor, and through the online software, the patient can easily make their appointments. The manager of the clinic can update the appointment status of the patients making it more informative. 

**Overall Description:** 

**Product Perspective** 

There are several online appointment scheduling tools in the marketplace, some of which are feature-loaded, easy to set up, and cheap. For doctors, online appointment scheduling brings a lot of value-added services and benefits, like engaging the patient, making the patient feel appreciated, and being able to store patientsâ€™ data securely for future reference. But the most wonderful and useful advantage is that online appointment scheduling is amazingly low cost.
