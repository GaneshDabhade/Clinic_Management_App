**Purpose**

But they usually end up waiting for very long periods of time. The patient can, however, decide to schedule an appointment, but this option does not usually work well for all parties involved. Parties involved include the patient, the medical personnel, and the hospital. Thus, this project focuses on making a system that helps customers to book appointments online along with other useful features. 

**Product Scope**

The manager of the clinic can update the appointment status of the patients making it more informative.
